# Two Sum (C++)

## Problem
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

Example:
- nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9 → [0,1]
- nums = [3,2,4], target = 6 → [1,2]
- nums = [3,3], target = 6 → [0,1]

## Reflection (for submission)

**How long did you spend on this assignment?**  
~30–45 minutes, including refreshing arrays and maps.

**Based on your effort, what letter grade would you say you earned?**  
A  

**Based on your solution, what letter grade would you say you earned?**  
A  

**Summary of what doesn’t work / where I struggled**  
Nothing major is broken. I first thought of a brute force O(n²) loop, but I switched to an O(n) solution with a hash map.  
The only hiccup was recalling `unordered_map` syntax; once I refreshed that, everything worked fine.
